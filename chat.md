### Lovable: Vibe Coding

### Prompt 1:
🥘 CookWise: App Description & Vibe
CookWise is presented as an intelligent social platform for food and cooking designed to empower busy individuals to eat well by making nutritionally balanced meals accessible and affordable. It aims to solve the "Urban Nutrition Crisis" by tackling the primary barriers to cooking: time constraint, mental overload, lack of skill, and waste risk.

Core Promise (The Vibe): "Eat better, spend smarter, waste less." 

Target User Vibe: Diverse urban populations united by the challenge of balancing nutrition, cost, and time (e.g., University Students, Working Adults, Families, and Elderly Home Cooks).

Overall Goal: To make healthy eating feel achievable rather than overwhelming.


✨ Key App Features for Vibe Coding
1. Smart Recipe & Problem-focused Bundles
This feature is focused on efficiency, affordability, and waste reduction.
- Function: An algorithm groups recipes by shared ingredients to reduce waste and cost per meal.
- Example Vibe: Buying one bag of spinach unlocks three complete meals (morning smoothie, lunchtime stir-fry, evening soup).
- Personalization and filter: Recipes are tailored to available (selected) ingredients, budget, appliances, regional style, and user-specified spice preference.
- Guidance: Problem-focused bundles are available for cooking beginners or those with minimal equipment (e.g., "rice cooker only" sets).

2. Food Science Simplified
This feature is focused on education and confidence-building.
- Function: Provides visual guides and explanations to help users understand the "why" behind cooking.
- Examples: Learning how lemon juice boosts iron absorption, why certain spices aid digestion, and which ingredient pairings maximize nutrition and flavor.
- Vibe Element: Makes nutrition visible and rewarding through nutritional badges and tips.

3. Community Exchange (Social Platform)
This feature is focused on culture, connection, and social learning.
- Function: Users can share, cook, rate, remix, and chat about recipes.
- Content: The Community Wisdom Feed features scrollable recipe stories, including the creator's photo, a food image, a brief narrative about the dish's cultural significance, and an ingredient list.
- Moderation: User comments need to be approved by an algorithm (to screen for hate speech, etc.).
